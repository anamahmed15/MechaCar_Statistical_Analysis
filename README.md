# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

# Purpose
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. This is an exploratory analysis to pinpoint the problems in order to find solutions.

# Linear Regression to Predict MPG
To predict the effect of each variable in the given dataset on the MPG rating of the new MechaCar, I performed a multiple linear regression model. For the model, the null and alternative hypotheses are:

* H0 : The slope of the linear model is 0, indicating that there is no significant linear relationship.

* Ha: The slope of the linear model is not 0, indicating a linear relationship between at least some of the variables.

The resulted output is:
